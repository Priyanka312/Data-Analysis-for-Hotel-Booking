<h2 align="left">📊 Project Overview
<br><br><br>
<p align="justify" style="font-size:14px;">
This project analyzes booking cancellations for City Hotel and Resort Hotel to identify key factors influencing cancellation rates and provide actionable recommendations to increase revenue and room utilization. Using real-world hotel booking data (2015–2017), the analysis explores trends in pricing, seasonality, customer origins, and booking channels.
