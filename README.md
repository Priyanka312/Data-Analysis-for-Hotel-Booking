🏨 #Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis
##📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes booking cancellations for City Hotel and Resort Hotel to identify key factors influencing cancellation rates and provide actionable recommendations to increase revenue and room utilization. Using real-world hotel booking data (2015–2017), the analysis explores trends in pricing, seasonality, customer origins, and booking channels.

#🎯 Business Problem

Both hotels have experienced high cancellation rates, leading to:

Decreased revenue

Poor room utilization

Inefficient pricing and promotional strategies

The goal is to identify why customers cancel bookings and recommend data-driven strategies to minimize cancellations.

📈 Objectives

Identify variables affecting hotel reservation cancellations.

Recommend ways to reduce cancellations.

Support hotels in pricing and promotional decision-making.

🧠 Hypotheses

Higher prices lead to more cancellations.

Longer waiting lists increase cancellation likelihood.

Most customers book via offline travel agents.

⚙️ Methodology

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Removed nulls, duplicates, and outliers (2015–2017).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed in Python, using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Feature Analysis: Explored cancellation patterns by price, month, hotel type, and country.

Visualization: Created charts and graphs to reveal business insights.

🔍 Key Insights

37% of total bookings are canceled.

City hotels receive more bookings than resort hotels, possibly due to lower prices.

August shows the highest booking and cancellation volume; January shows peak cancellations.

Higher ADR (Average Daily Rate) directly correlates with increased cancellations.

Portugal has the highest number of cancellations.

46% of bookings come through online travel agencies, while direct bookings are minimal.

💡 Recommendations

Revise Pricing Strategy: Offer dynamic pricing and promotions during high-rate periods.

Target Off-Season Months: Run marketing campaigns in January to boost confirmed bookings.

Improve Guest Experience: Enhance hospitality quality, especially in regions with high cancellations (e.g., Portugal).

Discount Weekends & Holidays: For resort hotels, use discounts to reduce cancellations during peak price periods.

Diversify Booking Channels: Encourage direct bookings through loyalty programs and exclusive discounts.
