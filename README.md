<br><br><br>
<p align="justify" style="font-size:16px;">
This project analyzes booking cancellations for City Hotel and Resort Hotel to identify key factors influencing cancellation rates and provide actionable recommendations to increase revenue and room utilization. Using real-world hotel booking data (2015–2017), the analysis explores trends in pricing, seasonality, customer origins, and booking channels.

<h2 align="left">⚙️ Methodology

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Removed nulls, duplicates, and outliers (2015–2017).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed in Python, using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Feature Analysis: Explored cancellation patterns by price, month, hotel type, and country.

Visualization: Created charts and graphs to reveal business insights.

<h2 align="left">🔍 Key Insights

37% of total bookings are canceled.

City hotels receive more bookings than resort hotels, possibly due to lower prices.

August shows the highest booking and cancellation volume; January shows peak cancellations.

Higher ADR (Average Daily Rate) directly correlates with increased cancellations.

Portugal has the highest number of cancellations.

46% of bookings come through online travel agencies, while direct bookings are minimal.

Target Off-Season Months: Run marketing campaigns in January to boost confirmed bookings.

Improve Guest Experience: Enhance hospitality quality, especially in regions with high cancellations (e.g., Portugal).

Discount Weekends & Holidays: For resort hotels, use discounts to reduce cancellations during peak price periods.

Diversify Booking Channels: Encourage direct bookings through loyalty programs and exclusive discounts.
