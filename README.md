<h2 align="left">🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis </h1></br>
<h2 align="left">📊 Project Overview
<br><br><br>
<p align="justify" style="font-size:14px;">
This project analyzes booking cancellations for City Hotel and Resort Hotel to identify key factors influencing cancellation rates and provide actionable recommendations to increase revenue and room utilization. Using real-world hotel booking data (2015–2017), the analysis explores trends in pricing, seasonality, customer origins, and booking channels.

<h2 align="left">⚙️ Methodology
<br><br>
<p align="justify" style="font-size:14px;">
1.Data Cleaning & Preparation: Removed nulls, duplicates, and outliers (2015–2017). <br>

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed in Python, using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. <br>

3.Feature Analysis: Explored cancellation patterns by price, month, hotel type, and country.<br>

4.Visualization: Created charts and graphs to reveal business insights.<br>
</p>
<h2 align="left">🔍 Key Insights
<br><br>
  <p align="justify" style="font-size:14px;">
1.37% of total bookings are canceled.<br>

2.City hotels receive more bookings than resort hotels, possibly due to lower prices.<br>

3.August shows the highest booking and cancellation volume; January shows peak cancellations.<br>

4.Higher ADR (Average Daily Rate) directly correlates with increased cancellations.<br>

5.Portugal has the highest number of cancellations.<br>

6.46% of bookings come through online travel agencies, while direct bookings are minimal.<br>
